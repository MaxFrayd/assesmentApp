# Avelios Medical Frontend Coding Challenge

## Technical Requirements

- Make sure that you have the node version `18.16.0 (lts)` installed ([nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
- Make sure that you have [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#debian-stable)
- Make sure that no applications are running on the ports `3000` and `4000`


## Setup

For this task you have to run a local node backend as well as a local frontend.
Please make sure to start the backend before running the frontend.

### Backend (Port 400)

You can find the backend in the folder [/backend](./backend).

To execute the backend change into the mentioned directory and execute:

```shell
yarn
```
to install all required dependencies. And

```shell
yarn start
```

to run the backend server.

After running the backend you should see a command line message stating:

```
üöÄ  Server ready at: http://localhost:4000/
```

**‚ùóImportant: do not change anything within this project!**

### Frontend (Port 3000)

You can find the backend in the folder [/frontend](./frontend). This folder contains a set of programming tasks which are marked as such.
You can derive all further implementation details in those files.

To execute the frontend change into the mentioned directory and execute:

```shell
yarn
```
to install all required dependencies. And

```shell
yarn start
```

to run the frontend server. 

After the execution you can access the frontend via the url [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your preferred browser.
